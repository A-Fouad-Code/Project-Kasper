# Project-Kasper

### Copyrights

I got this design from a YouTube channel called **_Elzero web school_** and here is a link to the [_playlist_](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDoPjvoNmBAy1l-2A21ng3gxEyocruT0t).<br />
I also got the material included in the design like photos and video from their [_Git repo_](https://github.com/ElzeroWebSchool/HTML_And_CSS_Template_Two).

### Future plans

In the upcoming months I will learn **JavaScript** and will add more features to this project to make it a bit unique.  
The Journey will take a lot of time I know it but eventually I will succeed.
